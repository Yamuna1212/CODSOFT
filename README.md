This repository showcases three distinct AI-driven projects:

Book Recommendation System - A content-based filtering system that recommends books based on user preferences.
Tic-Tac-Toe AI - An AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm.
Rule-Based Chatbot - A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.

Projects Overview
1. Book Recommendation System
A simple recommendation system for books based on textual features such as Title, Author, and Genre. The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend similar books to the user.

Key Features:
Content-based filtering (based on the text features).
TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between books.

2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI
This project implements an unbeatable AI player for the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It uses the Minimax algorithm (with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning) to determine the best possible move for the AI player, making it impossible for the human player to win.

Key Features:
Minimax Algorithm for decision making.
Play against an AI that always makes the optimal move.
Two-player option: Human vs. AI.

3. Rule-Based Chatbot
A simple Rule-Based Chatbot that responds to user inputs using predefined patterns and responses. The chatbot can provide information about the time, date, greetings, and other predefined queries using if-else statements.

Key Features:
Uses if-else statements to match user queries.
Can answer simple questions like greetings, time, or date.
Easy-to-understand logic for beginners learning natural language processing (NLP).
